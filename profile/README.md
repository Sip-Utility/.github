## About Sip

Sip is a professional-grade color picker and management tool designed for anyone who works with color, from graphic designers and web developers to digital artists and marketing professionals. It transforms the simple act of identifying a color into a powerful, organized workflow. Instead of relying on basic, one-time pickers, Sip allows you to build a living library of colors. You can capture inspiration from a website, a photo, or an app interface, save it with a descriptive name, and have it instantly available in your preferred code or design format whenever you need it.

The application excels through its deep integration and convenience. It lives in your menu bar, always ready with a global hotkey. When picking, it shows a magnified loupe for pixel-perfect accuracy and displays the color's value in multiple formats simultaneously. Its palette management is intuitive, allowing you to create collections for client brands, design systems, or personal projects. For teams, the ability to share palettes via iCloud ensures consistency. By making color capture, organization, and reuse effortless, Sip becomes an indispensable utility that saves time and ensures accuracy in any color-sensitive task.
